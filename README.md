## Assumptions

Moment calculations made with the following assumptions:

  - Doubly symmetric compact I-shaped members bent about their major axis
  - F<sub>y</sub> = 50 ksi
  - E = 29000 ksi
  - C<sub>b</sub> = 1
  - c = 1 from AISC Specification Equation F2-8a for doubly symmetric I-shaped members
  - Straight line interpolation between points at 1 ft. intervals

## Calculations
